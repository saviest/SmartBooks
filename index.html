</h2>

<p>SmartBooks is an intelligent system that allows students and professors to find the magazines and books easier and quicker than the traditional way of searching material at the library. This system pretends to help the users on their search of a material from the library.
The principal way of helping them is to have a personalized search based an account which contains selections, enrolled courses and past rated books and magazines taken from the library. The user will also have an easy way to find the material in the library because of an interactive system of lights that will show the location of the material needed just by selecting the material needed.
The system is pretend to work by an android/apple/computer application with a customizable environment that will be connected to the ambient of the library via Wi-Fi sending the notifications and signals to the system so it can work correctly and work with the right process for the right user.
The project is meant to be used principally by students and professors but it will also help dependants of the library, workers of the Politecnico di Torino, book providers and cleaners attendants.</p>

<p>AmI step
Description
Sensing
The system will use NFC sensors to activate the operation.
Reasoning
From your cellphone you can track the location inside the library
Acting
The equipment inside the library, like led lights, will be able to show the way to arrive at the book.
Interacting
Library users in any area of study in college, with problems to  find any book interesting to the class or for personal interesting, they could find out  following the lights.</p>

<h2>
<a id="ami-features" class="anchor" href="#ami-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AmI features</h2>

<p>AmI feature
Description
Sensitive
Trougth the NFC sensors the app can turn on .
Responsive
Through the led Lights insides the library, the user can notice the location of book, that they need.
Adaptive
The system  can detect who is using the system, and could recommend which kinds of books could be attractive to the user, showing in parallel of the search of the user.
Transparent
Due to the little sensors and the platform in the cellphone the system could look like insivible.
Ubiquitous
Since the user's entrance in the library the system follows the user a long his stay. 
Intelligent
Trough of the database, the system could be able to know the preferences of the user and recommend new books or material.</p>

<a id="open-issues" class="anchor" href="#open-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Issues</h2>

<p>What are the main problems that you expect your project will be facing? What is non-trivial in your work? What kind of help do you need in learning what you need?
Do you need some kind of “contact” to some company, or to some researcher, or to some Politecnico service, in order to develop your project?
Think about how you will show/demonstrate your project: will it be feasible on a LADISPE table? Do you need special locations? More space? Special devices?</p>

<p>The capability to find out the right sensors to the system and the application of them and the recognition and configuration of the NFC sensors could generate several problems. A major knowledge of sensors that work like the NFCs and vinculation of companies that work developing sensors is essential for the success of the proyect.
The demonstration of this of this project in a LADISPE table is factible, but we think that will need a special devices or elements to do it like certain sensors. </p>
